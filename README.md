# F8-Clone

F8-Clone is made partially functional based on the official F8 website which is a Vietnamese version of freeCodeCamp. 

•	Implemented index, course, user page and structured the database for basic interactions between the user and their active/inactive courses.

•	Used NodeJs with Model-View-Controller design pattern for backend, Bootstrap for frontend, and MongoDB for database.
